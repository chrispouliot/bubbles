//!
//! This defines the *call surface* the onboarding flow needs, mirroring the
//! sequence the upstream Dart app runs through `rust/src/api/api.rs`
//! (which is itself thin glue over `rustpush`).
//!
//! The handles below (`Config`, `Connection`, `Account`, ...) are opaque: the
//! flow never inspects them, it only threads them between `Backend` calls. The
//! real backend (the lifted, de-FRB'd `api.rs`) wraps the corresponding
//! `rustpush` `Arc<...>` types inside them; [`stub::StubBackend`] wraps unit
//! values so the UI compiles and is click-through-able today.

    //! distinguish at least three states — bottles present, no bottles,
    //! and unavailable/error — so errors can be surfaced/logged and
    //! don't masquerade as first-time establish.
    //!
    //! The pre-fix `Backend::get_viable_escrow_bottles` returns
    //! `Vec<(EscrowData, String)>` defaulting to empty, and the real
    //! backend's implementation (in `rustpush_backend.rs` ≈line 1630)
    //! has multiple silent `return Vec::new()` paths: reconstruct
    //! failure, missing `keychain.plist`, and
    //! `keychain.get_viable_bottles().await` error. The UI handler at
    //! `ui/mod.rs` ≈line 2105 then branches on `bottles.is_empty()`
    //! and shows the old establish prompt — silently treating errors
    //! as "no bottles". This is the user-reported bug: Sync Now shows
    //! no device dropdown, only the two text boxes, because the
    //! backend's `Vec` return collapsed an error into the empty path.
    //!
    //! The fix introduces `super::BottlesLookup` (an enum with three
    //! variants) and a `super::decide_bottles_lookup_action` helper
    //! that maps the three states to three distinct actions. The
    //! `Unavailable` variant carries the error reason and maps to a
    //! non-establish action so errors are surfaced/logged and don't
    //! masquerade as first-time establish.
    //!
    //! This test fails to compile under the pre-fix code because
    //! `super::BottlesLookup` and `super::decide_bottles_lookup_action`
    //! do not exist. The compile error is the expected red per the
    //! unit's spec (the seams are the deliverable, not a fake stub).
    //!
    //! Test isolation: the test constructs `BottlesLookup` values
    //! directly and calls a pure function; no backend, no shared
    //! state, no env vars.
